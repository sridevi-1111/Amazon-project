ðŸš€ Amazon-style Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization
I built a Power BI dashboard that predicts SKU-level demand and recommends optimal reorder points â€” helping retailers keep products in stock while cutting excess inventory.
ðŸ“Š Project Highlights:
Forecast Accuracy (MAPE): 8.5% (last 90 days)
Fill Rate: 94.7%
Stockout Risk Reduction: ~6%
Reduced excess stock & improved service levels
ðŸ›  Tools & Methods:
Power BI for interactive dashboards
Python for time-series forecasting (lag & rolling features)
Public retail dataset simulating Amazonâ€™s demand patterns
ðŸ’¡ Business Impact:
 This approach ensures customers always find products available while lowering holding costs â€” a win for both sales and operations.
